# ESP-32 Embedded project

This repository documents my journey learning embedded programming using the ESP-32 Wrover dev kit from freenove.
Development kit can be found here: [ESP-32 Dev Kit](https://store.freenove.com/products/fnk0046)

I will do my best to document my project as it comes along. Proving breakdowns of the code and the technical drawings as i gain a better understanding for the electronics.
